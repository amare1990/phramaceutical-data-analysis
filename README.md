# Pharmaceutical Data Analysis and Prediction

> Pharmaceutical Data Analysis and Prediction is a data science project designed to statistically analyze and extract insights from the data from Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. This data science project attempts to conduct Exploratory Data Discovery and Analysis (EDA). It finds key insights from the data using statistical and EDA analysis and from the histogram, bar charts, and correlation matrix. It also implements preprocessing functionality and builds Machine Learning (ML) models using RandomForest and Deep Learning (DL) using LSTM sequence models. It is implemented using Python programming language and various tools including jupyter notebook.

## Built With

- Major languages used: Python3
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn
- Tools and Technlogies used: jupyter notebook, Git, GitHub, Gitflow, VS code editor.

## Demonstration and Website

[Deployment link](Soon!)

## Getting Started

You can clone my project and use it freely and then contribute to this project.

- Get the local copy, by running `git clone https://github.com/amare1990/phramaceutical-data-analysis.git` command in the directory of your local machine.
- Go to the repo main directory, run `cd phramaceutical-data-analysis` command
- Create python environment by running `python3 -m venv venm-name`, where `ven-name` is your python environment you create
- Activate it by running:
- `source venv-name/bin/activate` on linux os command prompt if you use linux os
- `myenv\Scripts\activate` on windows os command prompt if you use windows os.

- After that you have to install all the necessary Python libraries and tools by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To run this project, run `jupyter notebook` command from the main directory of the repo

### Prerequisites

- You have to install Python (version 3.8.10 minimum), pip, git, vscode.

### Dataset

 - `store.csv`, `train.csv`, and `test.csv` are the datasets from `Kaggle` used to conduct statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
 - Run `df = pandas.read_csv("/path to your dataset")` to get the pandas data =frame for each dataset.
 - The store dataset is merged with the train and test data so that the `store` feature both in the train and test data are expanded more with details.

### Project Requirements
- Git, GitHub setup, adding `pylint' in the GitHub workflows
- Statistical and EDA analysis on the data, ploting
- Gaining insightful information by cinducting various tricks and visualizations
- Preprocessing data

#### GitHub Action
- Go to the main directory of this repo, create paths, `.github/workflows`. And then add `pylint` linters
- Make it to check when Pull request is created
- Run `pylint scripts/script_name.py` to check if the code follows the standard format
- Run `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive scripts/script_name.py` to automatically fix some linters errors

### Customer Purchasing Behaviour Analysis

The main functionality is implemented in `customer_behaviour.py` module and the `customer_behaviour_pipeline_processing.py` pipelines all processes. `customer_behavior_eda.ipynb` is the notebook you call the method in the pipeline processor module.
In this portion of the task, the following analysis has been conducted.

- Fix mixed data types
  Converted into string data type

- Data Summary:
    Summarize statistical descriptive statistics for both numerical features and object type features too.

- Data Quality Check:
    Identify and address missing values.
    Detect outliers and remove.
    Replace nan/empty/infinity/-infinity with median.
    Save cleaned data
- Visualizations of Sales and customers distribution via histograms
- Visualizations for the effect of state holidayas over sales and customers.
- Heatmap for relationships between numerical features
- Finding top ten stores promo should be deployed for
- Trends of customer behavior during store opening and closing times
- Viewing stores that are open in weekdayas and the effect of this over sales
- viewing how assortment types affect sales via visualizations
- Effect of the distance to the next competitor on sales via visualizations
- Effect of opening or re-opening of new competitor on stores via visualizations

  Run /open the jupyter notebook named `customer_behavior_eda.ipynb` to clean data

### Store Sales Prediction
- The main functionality is implemented in `store_sales_prediction.py` module and the `store_sales_prediction_pipeline_processor.py` pipelines all processes.  `store_sales_prediction_pipeline_processor.ipynb` is the notebook you call the method in the pipeline processor module.
- In this portion of the task, the following analysis has been conducted.
- Extracting couple of features from the data
- Preprocessing the data
- Building `RandomForestRegression` regression model to predict total sales
- Building `LSTM` regression model to predict total sales
- Saving the built models

### Creating API endpoints
- Chose `Django rest framework` as a framework for building a REST api
- Installed django and django rest framework
- Imlemented a module, `services.py` inside the django app, `models_api_services` to add functionality to load the model built and add a functionality to preprocess the data and predict
- Created an api endpoints to process posted requested data and predict. This functionality is written in the `views.py` script inside the django app.
